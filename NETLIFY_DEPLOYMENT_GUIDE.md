# Netlify Deployment Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeScript Installation Error
- **Problem**: Build was failing with TypeScript installation error and missing `debug` package
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `debug` package as a dependency
  - Ensured TypeScript is properly installed in devDependencies
  - Cleaned npm cache to resolve package resolution issues

### 2. Netlify Configuration
- **Problem**: Netlify configuration was not optimized for Next.js
- **Solution**:
  - Added `@netlify/plugin-nextjs` plugin for proper Next.js support
  - Updated `netlify.toml` with correct plugin configuration
  - Removed problematic admin role condition from redirects

### 3. Build Command Optimization
- **Problem**: Build command wasn't ensuring clean dependency installation
- **Solution**: Updated build command to use `npm ci` for consistent builds

## Current Configuration

### netlify.toml
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm ci && npm run build"
  publish = ".next"

[build.environment]
  NODE_ENV = "production"
  NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED = "1"
  NODE_VERSION = "18"

# Enable Next.js plugin
[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
```

### Dependencies Added
- `debug`: ^4.4.1 (runtime dependency)
- `@netlify/plugin-nextjs`: ^5.13.1 (dev dependency)
- `typescript`: 5.9.2 (dev dependency)

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Netlify build configuration"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Connect your repository to Netlify
   - Netlify will automatically use the `netlify.toml` configuration
   - Build command: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`

3. **Environment Variables** (if needed):
   - Set any required environment variables in Netlify dashboard
   - `NODE_ENV` is already set to "production" in netlify.toml

## Build Verification

The build now works locally:
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ Next.js build completes without errors
- ✅ All routes properly generated
- ✅ Static and dynamic routes configured

## Next Steps

1. Push your changes to your repository
2. Connect to Netlify (if not already connected)
3. Trigger a new deployment
4. Monitor the build logs to ensure successful deployment

The build should now complete successfully on Netlify!
